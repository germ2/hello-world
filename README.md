# hello-world
My first repository, trying to get into coding and i'm starting here.
My name is jeremy im almost 35 years old and Ive always loved technology and making the world a better place
so one of the first things im wanting to do is reuse old laptops and computers or tablets even cell phones and flash them with a opperating system that will run smooth and perform a more spacific task.
